ProjektLabRead was a project at our school in which we had to create a Digital Rights Management toolkit for the hardware at our school's laboratory
The goal was to be able to log-in in the app, being able to add new IButtons ((hardware))[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IButton], assign a user to said IButton and assign rights to certain users (like being able to use one of the 3D-printers).
